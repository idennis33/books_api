#### Technologies Used

Here for this project I used Ruby on Rails on the backend and React on the frontend. Within the backend I used authecentication with JWT. 

### New Tech learned

The new tech learned was stlyed components. Which is a new CSS framework that allows you to remove css from your logic which helps with better looking code.


### Note to self

I would like to add features where everyone has their own book shelf. I think i didn't take into account for the many to many relationship. Where books belongs to users.
